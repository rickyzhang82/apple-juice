1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:05,602
Welcome to the first lecture in our
series on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.

2
00:00:05,602 --> 00:00:09,180
I want to start by introducing the four
lecturers who are going to be speaking in

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:09,900
the series.

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,660
The first lecturer is Joseph Bonneau.

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,060
He's a post doctoral researcher in
computer science at Princeton University.

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,300
The second lecturer is me, Ed Felten.

7
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,970
I'm a professor at Princeton in computer
science, and in the Woodrow Wilson School.

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,350
The third lecturer is Arvind Narayanan.

9
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:29,210
He's a computer science
professor at Princeton.

10
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:32,110
And fourth, our special guest
lecturer is Andrew Miller.

11
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:35,590
He's a PhD student in computer
science at the University of Maryland.

12
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:37,220
There will be eleven lectures in total.

13
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,780
In this lecture number one,
we're going to do two things.

14
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:44,720
First, we'll introduce some cryptographic
primitives that turn out to

15
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,380
be necessary for
talking about cryptocurrencies.

16
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,420
In particular,
we'll talk about cryptographic hashes and

17
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:51,440
digital signatures.

18
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,530
And we'll talk about some of the ways
in which those are used to build

19
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:56,250
cryptocurrencies.

20
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:00,355
And then at the end of the lecture, we'll
start talking about cryptocurrencies.

21
00:01:00,355 --> 00:01:02,935
And I'll give some examples
of simple cryptocurrencies.

22
00:01:02,935 --> 00:01:06,825
That illustrate some of the design
challenges that we need to deal with.

23
00:01:06,825 --> 00:01:10,835
I want to apologize for covering the
cryptographic material at the beginning.

24
00:01:10,835 --> 00:01:13,875
Unfortunately we have to eat some
of our vegetables a little bit,

25
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:17,085
in order to lay groundwork for
the cryptocurrency stuff.

26
00:01:17,085 --> 00:01:20,605
So if you came for the cryptocurrency
stuff let, me assure you first of all.

27
00:01:20,605 --> 00:01:22,700
That we will get to it in this lecture.

28
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,050
And that having laid
the groundwork in this lecture.

29
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:28,260
There's going to be a lot more
specifically cryptocurrency-focused

30
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,410
material in later lectures.

31
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:31,639
All right, so let's get to it.
