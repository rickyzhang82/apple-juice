1
00:02:06,646 --> 00:02:09,147
防患於未然
Brace the wind.

2
00:02:11,134 --> 00:02:13,719
陛下 光之王已完全兌現承諾
The Lord of Light has made good on his promise, my king.

3
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:16,555
他的火焰消融了積雪
His fires have melted the snows away.

4
00:02:16,606 --> 00:02:18,140
前路暢通
The way ahead is clear.

5
00:02:18,274 --> 00:02:19,775
進軍臨冬城
We ride for Winterfell.

6
00:02:19,809 --> 00:02:21,226
你定能馬到功成
And you will take it.

7
00:02:22,812 --> 00:02:26,231
主讓我看到波頓之旗在烈焰中燃燒
The Lord has shown me Bolton banners burning.

8
00:02:26,282 --> 00:02:28,901
你會得到你合法的王位
You will receive what is yours by right.

9
00:02:50,173 --> 00:02:51,673
陛下
Your Grace.

10
00:02:51,724 --> 00:02:53,225
準備整隊進軍
Prepare to form up.

11
00:02:53,259 --> 00:02:55,010
陛下
Your Grace.

12
00:02:58,348 --> 00:02:59,648
講
Tell me.

13
00:02:59,682 --> 00:03:03,352
大批士兵 在黎明前叛逃
The men, many deserted before dawn.

14
00:03:05,905 --> 00:03:07,523
逃了多少
How many?

15
00:03:07,607 --> 00:03:09,608
將近半數
Nearly half.

16
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:12,528
所有傭兵也把戰馬都騎走了
All the sellswords with all the horses.

17
00:03:23,289 --> 00:03:25,424
陛下
Your Grace.

18
00:03:27,177 --> 00:03:30,796
有話直說 還有什麼能糟過叛逃
Speak up. Can't be worse than mutiny.

19
00:04:01,294 --> 00:04:03,245
放她下來
Cut her down.

20
00:04:16,392 --> 00:04:18,260
陛下
Your Grace.

21
00:04:18,262 --> 00:04:21,263
剛剛梅麗珊卓夫人也逃離軍營了
The Lady Melisandre was just seen riding out of camp.

22
00:04:33,493 --> 00:04:35,611
召集剩餘人馬列隊
Get the men into marching formation.

23
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,615
進軍臨冬城
On to Winterfell.

24
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,256
只見他舉高雙手
He raised his hands

25
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:49,591
所有死人就立刻站起身來
and they all stood up at once.

26
00:04:52,295 --> 00:04:55,948
數以萬計 簡直是這世上最強大的軍隊
Tens of thousands of them. The biggest army in the world.

27
00:04:55,982 --> 00:04:57,633
你打算怎麼對付他們
So what are you gonna do?

28
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,689
只能希望他們不會爬城牆
I'm gonna hope they don't learn how to climb the Wall.

29
00:05:03,723 --> 00:05:06,475
但那些龍晶...
But the dragonglass...

30
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,311
沒人拿得回來了
No one's ever getting that back now.

31
00:05:09,362 --> 00:05:11,964
再說作用也不大
It wouldn't have mattered anyway.

32
00:05:11,998 --> 00:05:13,448
除非我們有一大堆
Not unless we had a mountain of it.

33
00:05:13,483 --> 00:05:16,118
可你殺了一個異鬼啊
But you killed a white walker.

34
00:05:16,152 --> 00:05:17,753
用長爪劍
With Longclaw.

35
00:05:19,322 --> 00:05:21,490
他們擊碎鋼斧 就像擊碎玻璃一般
I saw them shatter steel axes like they were glass.

36
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:24,493
-但那長爪劍   -是瓦雷利亞鋼
- But Longclaw... - Is Valyrian steel.

37
00:05:24,544 --> 00:05:27,112
七大國內現存幾把瓦雷利亞鋼劍
How many Valyrian steel swords are left in the Seven Kingdoms?

38
00:05:27,146 --> 00:05:28,964
屈指可數
Not enough.

39
00:05:31,618 --> 00:05:33,001
我是史上第一任
The first Lord Commander in history

40
00:05:33,052 --> 00:05:35,470
為挽救野人性命
to sacrifice the lives of sworn brothers

41
00:05:35,505 --> 00:05:37,589
而犧牲了守夜人兄弟的總司令
to save the lives of wildlings.

42
00:05:41,177 --> 00:05:42,406
跟黑城堡裏最招恨的人交友
How's it feel to be friends

43
00:05:42,407 --> 00:05:44,229
感覺如何
with the most hated man in Castle Black?

44
00:05:44,264 --> 00:05:46,315
從我第一天來此 你就是我朋友
You were friends with me when I first came here.

45
00:05:46,349 --> 00:05:48,433
我那時可沒機會贏得什麼選舉
And I wasn't winning any elections back then.

46
00:05:48,484 --> 00:05:51,520
敬我倆一杯
Here's to us, then.

47
00:05:51,522 --> 00:05:53,238
隨他們挖苦去吧
Long may they sneer.

48
00:06:01,664 --> 00:06:03,448
怎麼了
What?

49
00:06:05,802 --> 00:06:07,636
我想求你件事
I wanted to ask you something.

50
00:06:09,205 --> 00:06:11,206
只能向你求助
To ask something of you.

51
00:06:14,177 --> 00:06:17,012
把我 吉莉和孩子派去舊鎮
Send me, Gilly, and the baby to Oldtown

52
00:06:17,046 --> 00:06:19,214
這樣我就有機會成為學士
so I can become a maester.

53
00:06:19,216 --> 00:06:22,017
那才是我的志向所在 而不是當戰士
That's what I'm meant to be. Not this.

54
00:06:22,051 --> 00:06:25,270
山姆 你得留下
I need you here, Sam.

55
00:06:25,305 --> 00:06:27,723
如果你走了 誰還能為我提供可靠建議
If you leave, who's left to give me advice I trust?

56
00:06:28,808 --> 00:06:31,193
不是還有艾德嗎
Well, there's Edd.

57
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:36,531
我當上學士的話 會對你更有幫助
I'd be more use to you as a maester.

58
00:06:36,566 --> 00:06:40,535
因為伊蒙學士不在了 我會比任何人都更有用
More use to everyone now that Maester Aemon is gone.

59
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:43,372
學城有世上最大的圖書館
The Citadel has the world's greatest library.

60
00:06:43,406 --> 00:06:49,111
我會學到很多歷史 謀略 醫術
I'll learn about history, strategy, healing.

61
00:06:49,145 --> 00:06:50,812
還有其他知識
And other things,

62
00:06:50,847 --> 00:06:55,417
能在異鬼來襲時派得上用場
things that will help when-- when they come.

63
00:06:58,421 --> 00:07:01,123
要是吉莉還得留下來 她會沒命的
If Gilly stays here, then she'll die.

64
00:07:02,592 --> 00:07:05,961
被她起名叫山姆的那孩子也會沒命
And the baby that she named after me will die.

65
00:07:05,995 --> 00:07:09,231
最後為了保護他們 我也會搭上性命
And I'll end up dying, too, trying to protect them.

66
00:07:11,434 --> 00:07:14,186
如此一來 我臨死前看到的最後一幕
Which means that the last thing that I'll see in this world

67
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:17,189
將是他們被我辜負之後失落的眼神
will be the look in her eyes when I fail them.

68
00:07:21,944 --> 00:07:25,113
我寧願直面萬千異鬼 也不願如此
And I'd rather see a thousand white walkers than see that.

69
00:07:39,629 --> 00:07:41,680
謝謝你
Thank you.

70
00:07:43,216 --> 00:07:45,350
到了學城 他們還是會逼你立誓戒色的
You know that the Citadel will make you swear off women, too.

71
00:07:45,385 --> 00:07:47,636
有種他們試試看
Oh, they'll bloody try.

72
00:07:51,391 --> 00:07:53,742
-山姆  -怎麼了
- Sam. - What?

73
00:07:55,361 --> 00:07:57,345
山姆
Sam.

74
00:07:58,865 --> 00:08:01,149
你剛被人打得半死 你是怎麼...
You had just been beaten half to death. How did you--

75
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,819
我很小心的
Oh, very carefully.

76
00:08:05,688 --> 00:08:08,723
很高興世界末日還能給某人帶來點好處
I'm glad the end of the world's working out well for someone.

77
00:08:13,529 --> 00:08:15,597
我會回來的
I'll come back.

78
00:08:17,216 --> 00:08:19,050
祝你早日歸來
To your return.

79
00:08:19,085 --> 00:08:21,720
祝我早日歸來
To my return.

80
00:10:00,269 --> 00:10:03,605
嘿 這邊
Aye, this way.

81
00:10:37,974 --> 00:10:39,641
小姐
My lady!

82
00:10:41,944 --> 00:10:43,395
史坦尼斯
Stannis.

83
00:10:43,446 --> 00:10:45,564
史坦尼斯·拜拉席恩率領全部人馬殺來了
Stannis Baratheon is coming. His whole army.

84
00:10:45,615 --> 00:10:47,032
你怎麼知道是史坦尼斯
How do you know it's Stannis?

85
00:10:47,116 --> 00:10:48,984
他們舉著烈焰紅心旗
They're carrying his flaming heart banners.

86
00:10:48,986 --> 00:10:52,571
我在黑水河之役見過 絕對忘不了的
From the Blackwater. I'll never forget it.

87
00:11:29,825 --> 00:11:31,443
在這兒挖戰壕
Trench here.

88
00:11:31,494 --> 00:11:33,695
距城牆三百碼的地方再挖一道
Another one 300 yards from the castle wall.

89
00:11:33,697 --> 00:11:35,914
動作要快
Hurry them along.

90
00:11:35,948 --> 00:11:37,449
-對了 克魯  -在 陛下
- Right, Curlew. - Yes, sir.

91
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,700
在那兩條斜坡間挖一道
Dig between those two rises.

92
00:11:38,702 --> 00:11:40,635
-分散開  -我和你一起
- Spread out. - I'm with you.

93
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,871
-弓箭手!  -散開!
- Archers! - Spread out!

94
00:11:42,922 --> 00:11:45,507
即刻派一隊人徵收糧草
And send out a foraging party immediately.

95
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:47,842
日出之時攻城
Siege begins at sunrise.

96
00:11:47,877 --> 00:11:50,295
陛下 無法攻城了
There's not going to be a siege, Your Grace.

97
00:12:31,754 --> 00:12:34,472
我們沒法兒贏的
We've got no chance!

98
00:13:43,876 --> 00:13:46,411
別殺我 求你了
No, please, please.

99
00:14:39,598 --> 00:14:41,966
居然有女人為波頓出戰
Bolton has women fighting for him?

100
00:14:43,135 --> 00:14:45,286
我並不是為波頓家而戰
I don't fight for the Boltons.

101
00:14:46,622 --> 00:14:48,656
我是塔斯的布蕾妮
I'm Brienne of Tarth.

102
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:53,595
曾任藍禮·拜拉席恩的御林鐵衛
I was Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon.

103
00:14:59,735 --> 00:15:03,438
他被跟你同樣面孔的黑影殺死時 我在場
I was there when he was murdered by a shadow with your face.

104
00:15:06,275 --> 00:15:09,644
是你用血魔法殺了他嗎
You murdered him with blood magic?

105
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:16,951
是我
I did.

106
00:15:25,895 --> 00:15:28,396
以拜拉席恩家族
In the name of Renly of House Baratheon,

107
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:30,131
藍禮一世之名
First of His Name,

108
00:15:30,165 --> 00:15:33,151
以安達爾人和先民之合法國王
rightful King of the Andals and the First Men,

109
00:15:33,185 --> 00:15:36,437
七大王國統治者和全境守護之名
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm,

110
00:15:36,439 --> 00:15:40,542
我 塔斯的布蕾妮 判你死刑
I, Brienne of Tarth, sentence you to die.

111
00:15:46,732 --> 00:15:48,950
有什麼遺言嗎
Do you have any last words?

112
00:15:58,344 --> 00:16:00,295
盡你的職責 動手吧
Go on, do your duty.

113
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:20,448
看來任務完成了
Looks like we're done here.

114
00:16:36,165 --> 00:16:39,300
我投降!
I surrender! I surrender!

115
00:16:39,335 --> 00:16:41,336
我接受你的投降
And I accept your surrender.

116
00:16:53,148 --> 00:16:55,016
我們回去吧
Let's head back.

117
00:16:55,067 --> 00:16:57,352
我妻子肯定寂寞了
My wife must be lonely.

118
00:17:30,719 --> 00:17:32,136
夫人
My lady.

119
00:17:32,187 --> 00:17:34,439
我來護送你歸寢
I've come to escort you back to your chamber.

120
00:17:34,473 --> 00:17:37,025
請跟她走吧
Go with her, please.

121
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:43,731
我知道拉姆斯的為人
I know what Ramsay is.

122
00:17:43,782 --> 00:17:45,984
知道他會怎麼對付我
I know what he'll do to me.

123
00:17:48,737 --> 00:17:51,239
如果我注定要死
If I'm going to die,

124
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:54,792
讓我死得有尊嚴些吧
let it happen while there's still some of me left.

125
00:17:56,829 --> 00:17:58,496
死
Die?

126
00:17:59,548 --> 00:18:00,982
誰說你要死了
Who said anything about dying?

127
00:18:01,016 --> 00:18:02,684
你不能死
You can't die.

128
00:18:02,718 --> 00:18:04,452
你父親是北境守護
Your father was Warden of the North.

129
00:18:04,486 --> 00:18:06,421
拉姆斯需要你
Ramsay needs you.

130
00:18:08,757 --> 00:18:11,893
不過他可不需要你的全部
Though I suppose he doesn't need all of you.

131
00:18:11,927 --> 00:18:14,595
只需要能為他生育子嗣的部分
Just the parts he'll use to make his heir,

132
00:18:14,597 --> 00:18:17,765
等你為他生養了一兩個男孩之後 就沒用了
until you've given him a boy or two and he's finished using them.

133
00:18:19,351 --> 00:18:24,405
他就會找些駭人聽聞的招數對付你
Then he's got incredible plans for those parts.

134
00:18:25,741 --> 00:18:27,608
那我們要等他回來
So, shall we wait for him to come back

135
00:18:27,659 --> 00:18:29,610
還是現在就開始呢
or should we begin now?

136
00:18:31,613 --> 00:18:33,831
你讓我決定
You're leaving it to me?

137
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:35,500
那好
Good.

138
00:18:35,534 --> 00:18:37,285
現在開始吧
Let's begin.

139
00:18:39,621 --> 00:18:41,789
臭佬... 住手!
Reek... stop!

140
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,708
住手!
Stop!

141
00:18:50,349 --> 00:18:53,468
打開城門!
Open the gate!

142
00:19:00,526 --> 00:19:02,527
他回來了
He's coming back.

143
00:20:37,574 --> 00:20:41,209
看來我有事要做了
I can see I have my work cut out for me.

144
00:20:41,243 --> 00:20:43,461
你倆滾出去
You two, out.

145
00:21:37,849 --> 00:21:41,602
你在我名單上排第一 知道嗎
You were the first person on my list, you know.

146
00:21:41,637 --> 00:21:44,639
你可記得殺了西利歐·佛瑞爾嗎
For killing Syrio Forel. Remember him?

147
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:46,974
記不清了
Probably not.

148
00:21:49,027 --> 00:21:52,146
還有幾個我要殺的人
I've gotten a few of the others.

149
00:21:52,148 --> 00:21:55,316
千面神讓我忘卻很多
The Many-Faced God stole a few more from me.

150
00:21:55,367 --> 00:21:57,902
幸虧他還把你留給我
But I'm glad he left me you.

151
00:22:01,657 --> 00:22:03,574
知道我是誰嗎
Do you know who I am?

152
00:22:07,746 --> 00:22:10,047
我聽不清
I can't hear you.

153
00:22:18,423 --> 00:22:20,758
你知道我是誰
You know who I am.

154
00:22:20,809 --> 00:22:22,843
我是艾莉亞·史塔克
I'm Arya Stark.

155
00:22:31,937 --> 00:22:34,438
你知道你是誰嗎
Do you know who you are?

156
00:22:36,858 --> 00:22:38,609
你是無名之輩
You're no one.

157
00:22:39,661 --> 00:22:41,746
無足輕重
You're nothing.

158
00:23:25,374 --> 00:23:27,625
女孩取走一條性命
A girl has taken a life.

159
00:23:27,659 --> 00:23:30,127
不該取走的性命
The wrong life.

160
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,964
我說對了
I was right about her.

161
00:23:34,049 --> 00:23:35,416
確實
You were.

162
00:23:37,135 --> 00:23:39,253
你還沒準備好
You're not ready.

163
00:23:40,889 --> 00:23:42,640
完全沒有
Not at all.

164
00:23:46,061 --> 00:23:48,846
那人的命不該由你來取
That man's life was not yours to take.

165
00:23:50,365 --> 00:23:52,433
女孩從千面神那裏偷竊
A girl stole from the Many-Faced God.

166
00:23:54,152 --> 00:23:56,354
如今她生有所欠
Now a debt is owed.

167
00:24:02,444 --> 00:24:04,278
唯有死亡才能償還
Only death can pay for life.

168
00:24:17,459 --> 00:24:19,760
不要啊!
No! No!

169
00:24:19,795 --> 00:24:23,214
不要 你... 你別死!
No, you... don't die! Don't die!

170
00:24:28,837 --> 00:24:30,571
你為何哭泣
Why are you crying?

171
00:24:32,074 --> 00:24:33,774
他是我朋友
He was my friend.

172
00:24:33,809 --> 00:24:36,544
他不是 你不懂他說的話嗎
No, he wasn't. Didn't you listen to him?

173
00:24:37,879 --> 00:24:39,864
他是無名之輩
He was no one.

174
00:24:41,867 --> 00:24:45,119
可如果你是...
But if you're...

175
00:24:47,706 --> 00:24:49,090
那這是誰
who's this?

176
00:24:49,157 --> 00:24:51,058
無名之輩而已
No one at all.

177
00:24:51,093 --> 00:24:52,508
女孩從大廳取走人面之前
Just as a girl should have

178
00:24:52,509 --> 00:24:54,795
也應該是無名之輩
been before she took a face from the hall.

179
00:25:00,919 --> 00:25:03,604
人面為心無牽掛之人準備
The faces are for no one.

180
00:25:03,638 --> 00:25:05,172
你依然心有牽掛
You are still someone.

181
00:25:08,226 --> 00:25:10,644
對心有牽掛的人
And to someone,

182
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:12,179
人面堪比毒藥
the faces are as good as poison.

183
00:25:25,527 --> 00:25:27,044
我看不見了
I can't see.

184
00:25:33,034 --> 00:25:35,836
怎麼了
What's happening?

185
00:25:35,871 --> 00:25:37,955
怎麼回事
What's happening?!

186
00:25:47,717 --> 00:25:50,885
-祝你歸途平安  -謝謝
- I wish you a safe journey home. - Thank you.

187
00:25:55,974 --> 00:25:58,442
原諒我 孩子
Forgive me, child.

188
00:25:58,477 --> 00:26:02,313
願你福星高照
I wish you all the happiness in the world.

189
00:26:19,581 --> 00:26:21,832
說不定我會去探望你
Maybe I'll come visit you sometime.

190
00:26:21,883 --> 00:26:23,801
說不定是我探望你呢
Maybe I'll come visit you.

191
00:26:23,835 --> 00:26:25,469
早點來吧
Don't wait too long.

192
00:26:25,504 --> 00:26:27,221
家裏有個貴族千金等我去娶呢
Got a noblewoman to marry back home.

193
00:26:28,306 --> 00:26:29,924
你想娶個賢良淑女
You want a good girl,

194
00:26:29,975 --> 00:26:32,259
卻需要個風騷浪女
but you need the bad pussy.

195
00:26:35,347 --> 00:26:37,598
就等你了 爵士
Whenever you're ready, my lord.

196
00:26:53,281 --> 00:26:55,666
這次別跟丟了
Try not to lose it this time.

197
00:26:57,669 --> 00:27:00,538
我再也不讓它離身
I'll never take it off again.

198
00:27:00,589 --> 00:27:03,591
我知道你不想離開多恩
I know you didn't want to leave Dorne,

199
00:27:03,625 --> 00:27:05,793
但我很高興你要回家了
but I'm glad you're coming home.

200
00:27:05,795 --> 00:27:07,545
你母親對你萬分牽掛
Your mother's desperate to see you.

201
00:27:07,596 --> 00:27:09,964
我也高興崔斯丹與我們同行
I'm glad Trystane is coming with us.

202
00:27:09,966 --> 00:27:11,799
他是個好小伙
He seems like a nice boy.

203
00:27:11,801 --> 00:27:13,601
你很幸運
You're lucky.

204
00:27:13,635 --> 00:27:16,971
媒妁婚姻很少能...
Arranged marriages are rarely so...

205
00:27:16,973 --> 00:27:19,139
如此美滿
so well arranged.

206
00:27:19,224 --> 00:27:20,941
你說母親會喜歡他嗎
Do you think Mother will like him?

207
00:27:22,394 --> 00:27:25,813
只要看到你開心 她一定會喜歡的
If she sees you're happy, I'm sure she will.

208
00:27:25,815 --> 00:27:27,176
你真的這麼想嗎
You really believe that?

209
00:27:27,198 --> 00:27:29,984
除了自己的子女
Have you ever known your mother to like anyone

210
00:27:29,986 --> 00:27:32,319
你見過母親喜歡過別人嗎
aside from her children?

211
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:34,154
她喜歡你
She likes you.

212
00:27:34,205 --> 00:27:37,074
我可不確定
I'm not so sure about that.

213
00:27:37,158 --> 00:27:38,659
聽著...
Listen...

214
00:27:40,662 --> 00:27:42,963
有件事我想告訴你
there's something I wanted to tell you.

215
00:27:44,299 --> 00:27:47,468
也許我早該告訴你
Something I should have told you long ago.

216
00:27:47,502 --> 00:27:49,336
所以...
So...

217
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:54,224
你現在已見過世面
now that you've seen more of the world,

218
00:27:54,259 --> 00:27:57,928
也該明白世事多變
you've learned how complicated things can be,

219
00:27:57,979 --> 00:28:00,080
人心險惡
people can be.

220
00:28:00,115 --> 00:28:03,350
蘭尼斯特家與馬泰爾家曾是世仇
The Lannisters and the Martells have hated each other for years,

221
00:28:03,401 --> 00:28:05,653
可你卻愛上崔斯丹
but you've fallen in love with Trystane.

222
00:28:05,687 --> 00:28:08,405
真有點意外 我是說 該有多巧
It was an accident, really. I mean, what were the chances?

223
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,240
你剛好愛上了
You happen to fall in love with the man

224
00:28:10,275 --> 00:28:12,359
指定要嫁的人
you were assigned to marry?

225
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:14,161
其實...
My point is...

226
00:28:16,364 --> 00:28:19,366
我們無法選擇所愛的人
we don't choose whom we love.

227
00:28:19,417 --> 00:28:21,702
只是...
It just, well...

228
00:28:23,838 --> 00:28:26,340
我們情難自禁
it's beyond our control.

229
00:28:26,374 --> 00:28:28,258
-是不是聽起來很傻  -不 才不是
- I sound like an idiot. - No, you don't.

230
00:28:28,293 --> 00:28:30,844
我只是想說... 我想說
What I'm trying to say... what I'm trying

231
00:28:30,879 --> 00:28:33,597
卻沒能說出口的... 我知道你要說什麼
and failing to say... I know what you're trying to say.

232
00:28:33,632 --> 00:28:36,016
不 你不知道
No, I'm afraid you don't.

233
00:28:36,051 --> 00:28:37,718
我知道
I do.

234
00:28:40,939 --> 00:28:43,557
我知道
I know.

235
00:28:43,608 --> 00:28:45,192
你和母親的事
About you and Mother.

236
00:28:47,612 --> 00:28:49,980
一直隱約知道
I think a part of me always knew.

237
00:28:51,733 --> 00:28:54,735
我真的很高興
And I'm glad.

238
00:28:57,739 --> 00:29:00,374
為你是我父親而高興
I'm glad that you're my father.

239
00:29:35,243 --> 00:29:37,161
彌塞菈
Myrcella?

240
00:29:39,448 --> 00:29:41,782
彌塞菈
Myrcella?

241
00:29:48,123 --> 00:29:51,041
彌賽菈
Myrcella? Myrcella?

242
00:31:09,204 --> 00:31:11,371
你們愛她 對吧
You love her, don't you?

243
00:31:15,376 --> 00:31:17,544
怎能不愛呢
How could you not?

244
00:31:17,546 --> 00:31:21,014
當然你倆實在是希望渺茫
Of course it's hopeless for the both of you.

245
00:31:21,049 --> 00:31:24,551
一個競技場的傭兵 一個失寵的騎士
A sellsword from the fighting pits, a disgraced knight.

246
00:31:24,602 --> 00:31:26,720
你們的身份都配不上女王
Neither one of you is fit consort for a queen.

247
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:33,026
我們卻總是會愛上不該愛的女人
But we always want the wrong woman.

248
00:31:33,061 --> 00:31:35,145
他總是這麼聒噪嗎
Does he always talk so much?

249
00:31:37,982 --> 00:31:40,234
安達爾人喬拉
Jorah the Andal.

250
00:31:40,285 --> 00:31:42,452
灰蟲子
Torgo Nudho.

251
00:31:42,537 --> 00:31:43,987
他不該在這兒
He should not be here.

252
00:31:44,038 --> 00:31:45,372
是 可他確實在
No, but he is.

253
00:31:45,406 --> 00:31:48,075
女王已下令將他逐出城去
Our queen ordered him exiled from city.

254
00:31:48,126 --> 00:31:50,377
若不是因為他 女王已經死了
Our queen would be dead if not for him.

255
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:54,800
是真的 我差點也死掉 若不是因為這位...

256
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,600
小壯士

257
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:01,280
侏儒

258
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,410
應該是這個詞

259
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,110
抱歉

260
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:09,780
我的瓦雷語鼻音有些重

261
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:12,820
有些澀

262
00:32:12,901 --> 00:32:15,652
生澀 謝謝
Punela. Thank you.

263
00:32:15,687 --> 00:32:18,438
很抱歉
I am sorry.

264
00:32:18,489 --> 00:32:20,941
我沒能在場為女王而戰
Sorry I not there to fight for our queen.

265
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:22,489
你可真錯過了一場好戲
You missed a good scrap.

266
00:32:22,609 --> 00:32:23,994
那些都不重要了
None of that matters now.

267
00:32:24,078 --> 00:32:25,445
我們在這兒戲謔得越久
The longer we sit here bantering,

268
00:32:25,447 --> 00:32:28,031
丹妮莉絲在野外待的時間越長
The longer Daenerys is out there in the wilderness.

269
00:32:28,082 --> 00:32:30,450
他說的沒錯 龍朝北飛了
He's right. The dragon headed north.

270
00:32:30,452 --> 00:32:32,502
要找到她 我們就得往北走
If we're going to find her, that's where we'll have to go.

271
00:32:32,537 --> 00:32:33,620
我們
We?

272
00:32:33,622 --> 00:32:35,539
你是個蘭尼斯特
You're a Lannister.

273
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:38,508
女王一心要把你們家族趕下王座
The queen intends to remove your family from power.

274
00:32:38,543 --> 00:32:40,260
而我一心助她實現夙願
And I intend to help her do it.

275
00:32:40,295 --> 00:32:42,470
你到這兒才多久呢
You've been here for how many days now?

276
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:44,464
我已為她戰鬥多年
I've fought for her for years.

277
00:32:44,515 --> 00:32:46,099
自她年幼時起
Since she was little more than a child.

278
00:32:46,134 --> 00:32:48,385
-你背叛了她 -說話留神
- You betrayed her. - Careful now.

279
00:32:48,436 --> 00:32:50,804
她放逐了你 兩次 我記得
And she exiled you. Twice, I believe.

280
00:32:50,889 --> 00:32:52,472
第二次拜你所賜
The second time thanks to you.

281
00:32:52,523 --> 00:32:54,808
莫爾蒙 別把你的錯怪到我頭上
Don't blame me for your crimes, Mormont.

282
00:32:54,859 --> 00:32:57,561
他說得對 女王放逐了喬拉
He's right. Our queen exiled Jorah.

283
00:32:57,612 --> 00:33:00,614
他說的也沒錯 喬拉救了女王
And he's right. Jorah saved her life.

284
00:33:00,648 --> 00:33:02,649
也許她的看法有變
Perhaps she feels differently about him now.

285
00:33:02,651 --> 00:33:05,594
也許沒有 只有去問她才能知道
Perhaps not. The only way we'll know is if we ask her.

286
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,906
好吧 讓他加入我們吧
Fine, fine. I suppose he can join us.

287
00:33:08,957 --> 00:33:11,491
只要他保證不趁我睡覺時殺了我
Just as long as he promises not to kill me in my sleep.

288
00:33:11,493 --> 00:33:14,745
如果我要殺你 你可得時刻提防
If I ever kill you, your eyes will be wide open.

289
00:33:14,796 --> 00:33:17,497
等等 我們憑什麼要帶上你
Forgive me, but why would we bring you?

290
00:33:19,499 --> 00:33:20,334
什麼意思
Pardon me?

291
00:33:20,385 --> 00:33:22,502
你在野外捕過獵嗎
Have you ever tracked animals in the wilderness?

292
00:33:22,504 --> 00:33:25,389
沒 但我有別的本事
Not precisely, but I have other skills that would be useful.

293
00:33:25,423 --> 00:33:27,424
你很會打嗎
Can you fight?

294
00:33:27,508 --> 00:33:28,842
我以前打過
I have fought.

295
00:33:28,893 --> 00:33:30,677
不敢自稱偉大的戰士
I don't claim to be a great warrior.

296
00:33:30,728 --> 00:33:32,813
你騎術如何
Are you good on a horse?

297
00:33:32,847 --> 00:33:34,181
還好
Middling.

298
00:33:34,232 --> 00:33:36,350
你也就是會耍嘴皮
So mainly you talk.

299
00:33:36,352 --> 00:33:38,568
還會喝酒 我至今還活著
And drink. I've survived so far.

300
00:33:38,603 --> 00:33:41,989
我尊重你 但這次遠征你幫不上忙
Which I respect, but you would not help us on this expedition.

301
00:33:43,908 --> 00:33:45,959
不過你可以在彌林幫助我們
You would help us here in Meereen, though.

302
00:33:46,738 --> 00:33:48,829
我們沒人能夠治理一座城市
None of us have experience governing a city

303
00:33:48,863 --> 00:33:50,080
除了他
except for him.

304
00:33:50,114 --> 00:33:52,115
你想向女王證明你的價值
You want to prove your value to the queen?

305
00:33:52,166 --> 00:33:53,500
就在彌林這裏證明吧
Prove it right here in Meereen.

306
00:33:53,534 --> 00:33:56,286
他是個外國侏儒 不懂本地語
He's a foreign dwarf that barely speaks the language.

307
00:33:56,337 --> 00:33:57,788
彌林人怎麼會聽他的
Why would the Meereenese listen to him?

308
00:33:57,839 --> 00:33:59,706
他們不會聽他的
They wouldn't.

309
00:33:59,757 --> 00:34:01,625
但會聽灰蟲子的
They will listen to Grey Worm.

310
00:34:01,676 --> 00:34:03,293
我要跟你們去
I'll come with you.

311
00:34:03,344 --> 00:34:05,379
我會找到女王
I'll find our queen.

312
00:34:05,381 --> 00:34:07,848
-你身體太弱不便走動  -我能走
- You are not strong enough to go anywhere. - I am.

313
00:34:07,882 --> 00:34:10,133
他能 他是我見過的最有種的閹人
He is. He's the toughest man with no balls I ever met.

314
00:34:10,184 --> 00:34:13,303
但你還是不能去
But you still can't go.

315
00:34:13,388 --> 00:34:15,055
彌林人相信你
The people believe in you.

316
00:34:15,057 --> 00:34:16,890
他們知道你代表女王
They know you speak for the queen.

317
00:34:16,941 --> 00:34:18,859
是的
It's true.

318
00:34:18,893 --> 00:34:20,894
只有無垢者能維護彌林穩定
Only the Unsullied can keep the peace in Meereen.

319
00:34:20,979 --> 00:34:24,231
如果你走了 這個城市會發生內亂
If you leave, half this city will consume the other half.

320
00:34:24,282 --> 00:34:26,533
還有彌桑黛
And Missandei.

321
00:34:26,567 --> 00:34:29,486
女王最信任的人是彌桑黛
Our queen trusts no one more than Missandei.

322
00:34:29,537 --> 00:34:32,289
而不是我
Certainly not me.

323
00:34:32,323 --> 00:34:34,408
女王的閨中密友
The queen's closest confidante,

324
00:34:34,459 --> 00:34:37,127
無垢者的指揮官
the commander of the Unsullied,

325
00:34:37,161 --> 00:34:39,913
疤臉的外國侏儒
and a foreign dwarf with a scarred face.

326
00:34:41,132 --> 00:34:42,582
祝你們好運 我的朋友
Good fortune, my friends.

327
00:34:42,584 --> 00:34:44,501
彌林古老而輝煌
Meereen is ancient and glorious.

328
00:34:44,552 --> 00:34:46,586
千萬別把它毀了
Try not to ruin her.

329
00:34:48,256 --> 00:34:50,090
好像就剩我倆了 安達爾人喬拉
Looks like it's you and me, Jorah the Andal.

330
00:34:50,141 --> 00:34:52,225
去找幾匹好馬
Let's find some good horses.

331
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,644
我們有太多話要聊
We have so much to talk about.

332
00:35:27,595 --> 00:35:29,596
你好 老朋友
Hello, old friend.

333
00:35:31,349 --> 00:35:35,135
我以為我們相處得很愉快 你卻棄我於不顧
I thought we were so happy together until you abandoned me.

334
00:35:37,021 --> 00:35:39,806
你是怎麼找到我的 這問題大概也沒意義了
I suppose there's no point asking how you found me.

335
00:35:39,808 --> 00:35:42,192
鳥鳴於西 鳥鳴於東
The birds sing in the west, the birds sing in the east,

336
00:35:42,226 --> 00:35:44,478
只要你會側耳傾聽
if one knows how to listen.

337
00:35:45,696 --> 00:35:47,364
它們說 你已另有用武之地
They tell me you've already found favor

338
00:35:47,398 --> 00:35:49,483
輔佐龍母
with the Mother of Dragons.

339
00:35:49,534 --> 00:35:52,285
她的確沒處死我
Well, she didn't execute me,

340
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,655
這算是個好開始
so that's a promising start.

341
00:35:55,657 --> 00:35:57,791
現在英雄們都離城去找她了
Now the heroes are off to find her

342
00:35:57,825 --> 00:35:59,993
我卻被困在這裏
and I'm stuck here

343
00:35:59,995 --> 00:36:03,630
還要安撫這座城市 避免內亂
trying to placate a city on the brink of civil war.

344
00:36:03,664 --> 00:36:05,415
有什麼像樣的建議嗎
Any advice for an old comrade?

345
00:36:05,466 --> 00:36:06,967
情報最關鍵
Information is the key.

346
00:36:07,001 --> 00:36:09,553
要清楚敵人的力量和戰略
You need to learn your enemy's strengths and strategies.

347
00:36:09,587 --> 00:36:14,091
要分清哪些是真盟友 哪些不是
You need to learn which of your friends are not your friends.

348
00:36:14,142 --> 00:36:17,427
如果我認識一個消息靈通的人士該多好
If only I knew someone with a vast network of spies.

349
00:36:17,478 --> 00:36:19,513
但願如此
If only.

350
00:36:21,182 --> 00:36:27,070
一個宏偉古城 掣肘於暴力 腐敗和謊言
A grand old city choking on violence, corruption, and deceit.

351
00:36:27,105 --> 00:36:30,073
誰會有能耐去駕馭
Who could possibly have any experience

352
00:36:30,158 --> 00:36:32,943
這麼個巨大又笨拙的野獸
managing such a massive, ungainly beast?

353
00:36:38,616 --> 00:36:40,867
我確實懷念過你
I did miss you.

354
00:36:42,036 --> 00:36:43,787
我知道
Oh, I know.

355
00:37:05,393 --> 00:37:07,277
我們必須得回去
We have to go home.

356
00:37:13,618 --> 00:37:16,736
可憐的小傢伙
Oh, my poor, sweet thing.

357
00:37:16,821 --> 00:37:18,905
是不是很疼
Does it hurt?

358
00:37:21,576 --> 00:37:23,577
我們必須得回去
We have to go home.

359
00:37:26,747 --> 00:37:28,215
卓耿
Drogon.

360
00:37:28,249 --> 00:37:30,467
能帶我回彌林嗎
Can you take me back to Meereen?

361
00:37:34,589 --> 00:37:37,090
你帶我飛了多遠？
How far did you carry me?

362
00:37:45,183 --> 00:37:47,651
卓耿 我們得回去
Drogon, we need to return.

363
00:37:47,685 --> 00:37:49,436
我的子民需要我
My people need me.

364
00:38:21,686 --> 00:38:23,720
對了 沒吃的了
Well, there's no food.

365
00:38:23,771 --> 00:38:26,856
再怎麼說 晚上你能搞點吃得來吧
At the very least, you could hunt us some supper.

366
00:41:04,348 --> 00:41:05,799
認罪
Confess.

367
00:41:09,603 --> 00:41:11,805
認罪
Confess.

368
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,151
我有罪
I have sinned.

369
00:41:25,202 --> 00:41:27,987
我承認
I see that now.

370
00:41:28,038 --> 00:41:30,740
我許久以來怎能如此盲目
How can I have been so blind for so long?

371
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:34,961
我想重獲清白
I want to be clean again.

372
00:41:36,163 --> 00:41:38,381
望能免除罪責
I want absolution.

373
00:41:40,367 --> 00:41:44,170
我夢到老嫗高舉聖燈
The Crone came to me with her lamp raised high.

374
00:41:44,205 --> 00:41:45,905
在聖光照耀下...
And by its holy light--

375
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:48,475
想認罪嗎
You wish to make a confession?

376
00:41:51,712 --> 00:41:54,147
若我認罪 可否重獲自由
Once I've confessed, will I be free?

377
00:41:54,181 --> 00:41:57,183
那要看太后所犯何罪了
Your Grace will be dealt with according to her sins.

378
00:41:59,553 --> 00:42:01,788
聖母仁慈為懷
The Mother have mercy, then.

379
00:42:04,241 --> 00:42:06,893
我承認 我跟其他男人有婚外姦情
I lay with a man outside the bonds of marriage. I confess.

380
00:42:06,927 --> 00:42:08,661
他叫什麼
Name him.

381
00:42:12,833 --> 00:42:14,234
藍賽爾·蘭尼斯特
Lancel Lannister.

382
00:42:14,268 --> 00:42:17,504
你的堂弟 先王的侍從
Your cousin and the king's squire.

383
00:42:17,538 --> 00:42:20,373
-我那時寂寞無助  -你是有夫之婦
- I was lonely and afraid. - You had a husband.

384
00:42:20,458 --> 00:42:22,425
可我丈夫一門心思在外尋花問柳...
A husband off whoring every chance he--

385
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:25,378
你不能拿他的罪行為自己開脫
His sins do not pardon your own.

386
00:42:27,414 --> 00:42:29,466
願諸神寬恕我
May the gods forgive me.

387
00:42:31,652 --> 00:42:33,353
還有別人嗎
Other men?

388
00:42:34,438 --> 00:42:35,722
沒了
No.

389
00:42:35,724 --> 00:42:37,941
真沒了
No others?

390
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,194
沒了
No.

391
00:42:41,228 --> 00:42:44,731
欺騙諸神 罪不可恕
Speaking falsehoods before the gods is a great crime.

392
00:42:44,782 --> 00:42:46,316
你可明白
You understand this?

393
00:42:46,367 --> 00:42:48,034
明白
I do.

394
00:42:50,287 --> 00:42:52,155
傳言說你的三個孩子
There are those that say your children

395
00:42:52,206 --> 00:42:55,041
並非勞勃國王親骨肉
were not fathered by King Robert,

396
00:42:55,075 --> 00:42:58,661
傳言說他們是通姦亂倫所生的雜種
that they are bastards born of incest and adultery.

397
00:42:58,712 --> 00:43:00,580
謊言
A lie.

398
00:43:00,631 --> 00:43:02,916
定是史坦尼斯·拜拉席恩編造的謊言
A lie from the lips of Stannis Baratheon.

399
00:43:02,918 --> 00:43:05,635
他圖謀篡奪王位 卻被其侄捷足先登
He wants the throne, but his brother's children stand in his way.

400
00:43:05,669 --> 00:43:08,922
所以故意造謠說孩子非勞勃親骨肉
So he claims they are not his brother's.

401
00:43:08,973 --> 00:43:10,974
卑鄙無恥
That filth.

402
00:43:12,309 --> 00:43:14,561
這種傳言絕不可信
There is not one shred of truth to it.

403
00:43:14,595 --> 00:43:16,729
我否認
I deny it.

404
00:43:18,332 --> 00:43:20,233
很好
Good.

405
00:43:21,352 --> 00:43:24,771
但這些指控所涉罪名嚴重
But these are terrible charges.

406
00:43:24,822 --> 00:43:27,440
全國上下必須知道真相
And the realm must know the truth of them.

407
00:43:27,491 --> 00:43:29,943
若太后的供詞屬實
If Your Grace has given honest testimony,

408
00:43:29,945 --> 00:43:32,161
審判定能還你清白
your trial will prove your innocence.

409
00:43:32,196 --> 00:43:34,614
審判 我已認罪
Trial? I have confessed.

410
00:43:34,698 --> 00:43:36,316
只認了一項罪
To a single sin.

411
00:43:36,383 --> 00:43:38,284
其餘罪名你都否認了
Others you have denied.

412
00:43:38,335 --> 00:43:42,121
審判自能辨別孰是孰非
Your trial will separate the truths from the falsehoods.

413
00:43:44,291 --> 00:43:47,677
謹遵總主教的睿智決斷
I bow to the wisdom of Your High Holiness.

414
00:43:49,647 --> 00:43:51,965
可我能否懇求聖母
But if I might beg

415
00:43:51,967 --> 00:43:54,601
對我略施仁慈呢
for just one drop of the Mother's mercy.

416
00:43:56,687 --> 00:43:59,639
我已許久未見我兒子...
I haven't seen my son--

417
00:43:59,641 --> 00:44:02,442
早已記不清有多久了
I don't know how long it's been.

418
00:44:02,476 --> 00:44:04,310
請允許我見見他
I need to see him, please.

419
00:44:04,361 --> 00:44:08,181
