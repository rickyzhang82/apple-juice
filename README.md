PHP Video website for Apple TV airplay

## What is it?

It is a super lightweight php website that intends for streaming video/audio to Apple TV through your iOS devices.

## Why do I build it?

I bought a Sony DV, which produces a gazillion number of MP4 video clips. I want to watch them on my TV with a few clicks from my iPad. So I spent a night to learn php and build this website.

## What is requirement?
* an Apple TV connected to your TV
* an iOS device, such as iPhone and iPad
* a decent wifi network
* an ARM board/ a PC that hosts php website and your video/audio library.
* Video file must be in mp4 container and use h.264 codec for video and mpa codec for audio.
